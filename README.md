# flutter-feedback-form
A beginner friendly Flutter project where users can submit their name, email and give their feedback using simple input fields. The form validates user input and shows a success or retry message using pop-up dialogs. Built completely using DartPad, this project helped me understand the basics of Flutter UI, TextEditingController.
