# flutter-feedback-form
A beginner friendly Flutter project where users can submit their name, email and give their feedback using simple input fields. The form validates user input and shows a success or retry message using pop-up dialogs. Built completely using DartPad, this project helped me understand the basics of Flutter UI, TextEditingController.
# 📝 Feedback Form — My First Flutter Project

It’s a really simple app where the user can:
- Enter their **name**
- Enter their **email**
- Give some **feedback**
- Then click a **submit button**

If they leave anything blank, it shows a little pop-up asking them to fill all the fields.  
If everything is filled, it shows a success message. Simple and clean!

## 💡 Why I Built This

I’m currently learning Flutter, and I wanted to understand:
- How to take input using `TextFields`
- How to use `TextEditingControllers`
- How to show pop-up dialogs (like alerts)
- How to arrange widgets with `Column`, `Padding`, and `SizedBox`

Instead of just watching tutorials, I decided to **build something small but complete** — and this is it.

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Flutter (via DartPad)
- Dart Programming Language
- No Firebase or database yet — just local input and logic

## 🚀 What’s Next?

- I want to convert this into a full app with **Firebase backend**
- Add real-time feedback saving
- And eventually deploy it from **VS Code** to GitHub and maybe host it
